#
To set this environment up, create a .env file and add 
API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}

I am using dotenv to load grab the API_KEY from the env file this code is included in the Nasa_CA.py
You may need to install this using `pip install python-dotenv`

You need to also install
numpy `pip install numpy`
pandas `pip install pandas`
seaborn `pip install seaborn`
matplotlib `pip install matplotlib`
scipy `pip install scipy`

you made need to add `python -m` before each of these pip commands
